# wxnim
Nim wrapper for wxWidgets. Most common widgets have been wrapped but it's likely
that I missed a few.

Still in development, needs way more testing!


# Installation

Install ``wxnim`` *next to* a directory ``wxWidgets-3.0.2``::

  projects/wxwin
  projects/wxWidgets-3.0.2


# Installation on Windows

Compile wxWidgets
via ``mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc SHARED=0 UNICODE=1 BUILD=release``.

More details can be found here:

https://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Compiling_wxWidgets_with_MinGW

Compile the examples::

  cd examples

  nim cpp -r example2.nim


# Generating the Nim code

This wrapper has been generated by c2nim. To regenerate the Nim code, simply
run ``nim c -r scripts/convert``.


# Todo

- Make event handling support Nim's closures.
- Make the interface even more Nim-like.
